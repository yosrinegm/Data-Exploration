# Data-Exploration
This Project introduces how to explore data and build simple prediction model, to do so let us back to the year 1912, when the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this project, I will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To begin working with the RMS Titanic passenger data, we'll first need to import the functionality we need, and load our data into a pandas DataFrame. Hence, the code cell below will load our data and display the first few entries (passengers) for examination using the .head() function.
